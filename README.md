# Alkali

Provides basic SDKs for inter-component communication, isolating underlying implementation specifics.

This is not meant to provide binaries though (see [Isovaline](https://github.com/codecomet-io/isovaline) for that).

## Builder

Provides a SDK to manipulate a buildkitd instance.

## Caveats & TODO

* remove the dependency on isovaline (eg: pass home and runner name instead of depending on buried down config.Get)
